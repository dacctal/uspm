version = "0.0.0"             # make sure to put latest version; search may auto-resolve from source tags
source = "https://example.com/repo"  # Upstream Git or VCS URL (preferred: Git tag-able so search can auto-resolve)
description = "Short, plain-English summary of the package"
license = "MIT"              # SPDX identifier preferred (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0-only)
maintainer = "Your Name <you@example.com>"  # Required: who to contact for bumps/fixes

# Notes:
# - Keys are simple K=V pairs. Avoid adding custom keys without discussion.
# - Version may be inferred by search tooling when the source is a VCS with tags.
# - Keep description succinct; long docs belong in README or repo.
